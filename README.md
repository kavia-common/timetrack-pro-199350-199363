**Note added by Kavia Agent:**  
The folder `chronose_frontend` was missing the minimum required React app structure and could not start.  
A minimal `package.json`, `src/`, and `public/` layout were created to allow the React app to start and listen on port 3000, so health and preview checks succeed.  
You may now develop your lightweight time tracking frontend as planned.
